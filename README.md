This repository hosts the backend code for the Job Portal Website. It includes secure APIs for user management, job postings, and application tracking, using MongoDB as the database.

## **Features**  
- **Authentication and Authorization**:  
  - Implements JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.

- **Application Tracking**:  
  - APIs for job seekers to apply to jobs and track their application status.  
  - Employers can review and update application statuses.  
- **Scalable Database**:  
  - MongoDB is used to handle large datasets of job postings, user profiles, and applications efficiently.  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ORM  
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure user sessions  

## **Setup Instructions**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-portal-backend.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd job-portal-backend  
   ```  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  
4. Set up MongoDB:  
   - Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally or provide a remote MongoDB URI.  
5. Configure environment variables:  
   Create a `.env` file and include the following:  
   ```env  
   PORT=5000  
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>  
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>  
   ```  
6. Start the server:  
   ```bash  
   npm start  
   ```  

## **API Endpoints**  
- **Authentication**:  
  - `POST /auth/register` - Register a new user.  
  - `POST /auth/login` - Login and receive a JWT token.

  - `POST /jobs` - Create a new job posting (Employer only).  
  - `PUT /jobs/:id` - Update a job posting.  
  - `DELETE /jobs/:id` - Delete a job posting.  
- **Application Management**:  
  - `POST /applications` - Submit a new job application.  
  - `GET /applications` - View applications (Employer or Job Seeker).  

## **Usage**  
- Test API endpoints using Postman or similar tools.
